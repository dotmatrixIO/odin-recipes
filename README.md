This is the first project for The Odin Project web development course. I 
will be using HTML to create a basic website, consisting of an index page 
that leads to a few recipes. It will be basic, but it will be a great 
opportunity to practice the HTML I've learned so far.

In completing this project, I will demonstrate a beginner's understanding 
of HTML, git/github and use of the MACOS terminal.
